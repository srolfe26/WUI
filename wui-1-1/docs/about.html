<h1>WUI
    <span>Webteam User Interface</span>
    <span>version 1.1</span>
</h1>


<h2>Goals / Why Use it</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Its lightweight (currently @ 290K) on principle.</li>
    <li>Stay close to fundamental HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
    <li>Facilitate rapid app development</li>
</ul>


<h2>History</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Started out as a simple modal window interface I built for the web team at the USU Research Foundation. This inspired the totally original name.</li>
    <li>Expanded on by building some lightweight form elements for a content management system - ITS NOT A FRAMEWORK!!!</li>
    <li>Added some more advanced and really cool form elements (more on this later)</li>
    <li>Okay, its getting big, there's stuff that the CMS does that I want the forms to do, and maybe its a framework...</li>
    <li>
        <h3>Yep, I'll admit it, its a framework, here is the file structure:</h3>
        <div class="workspace structure">
            <h4>Webteam User Interface</h4>
            <div id="grid">grid.js</div>
            <div id="state">state.js</div>
            <div id="forms">forms.js</div>
            <div id="wui">wui.js</div>
            <div id="jquery">jQuery</div>
        </div>
    <li>Definitely a framework, and I want to use this externally. Check it in to <a href="https://github.com/srolfe26/WUI">GitHub</a></li>
    <li>AAAAAHHH! People want to use it, I haven't written any documentation! Its actually kind of a mess! Aaaah! &mdash; Working on this one.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why build on jQuery?</h2>

<p>
	The WUI was built on jQuery initially because that was how I knew how to do the most, the easiest, with JavaScript.  As my understanding of
	JavaScript increased I was tempted to write everything in native JS, but I wanted to make this framework as easy for a beginner as possible,
	and using jQuery facilitates that because it is so widely used.
</p>


<h2>Some Code</h2>
<ul>
	<li>With a very small amount of code you can have a very nice date/time control that can understand many common ways of expressing time (in English).
    	You can try typing in things such as, "Today at noon", "Yesterday at four thirty pm", "Five months from next Thursday", or something boring like
    	"9/22/2013 13:21". Go ahead and try it out. Notice that if you use the date picker that any time you entered will be retained. I think this
    	is a really neat control.
        <pre>
var a = new Wui.datetime({blankText:'Type a date and time in here', appendTo:$('#text-example')});
a.place();
        </pre>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            $(document).ready(function(){
                var a = new Wui.Datetime({blankText:'Type a date and time in here', appendTo:$('#text-example')});
                a.place();
            });
        </script>
        <div class="example" id="text-example"></div>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>A Diagram</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First, a diagram of everything available (this is actually the WUI 1.0 diagram, I need to update!):
    	<img src="../img/docs/wui-map.png" alt="wui-map" width="1444" height="2950">
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Prototypal Inheritance</li>
    <li>Its JavaScript!!! Yes, its built on jQuery, but its all just JavaScript, so relax. You can use it with other frameworks, you can write your own stuff. Its awesome.</li>
    <li>Check out the WUI Object to get a feeling for placing, hierarchy, push, splice and onRender.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Going Forward 
    <span>Road Map</span>
    <span>(aka Current Weaknesses)</span>
</h1>

<ul>
    <li>1. Documentation needs some work</li>
    <li>1. More testing. Its young! Increase the test bed, and create more unit tests.</li>
    <li>1. Uniformity - Update, this is 95% better since I first wrote this document, almost done.
        <ul>
            <li>ValChange vs. OnChange</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>How to structure apps - its not exactly MVC, but it'd sure be nice to get close, but not have it strictly enforced.</li>
</ul>
