        <h2>Update 3/12/16: Build Files</h2>
        
        <p>Reorganized WUI 1.2 and 1.2.1 to be able to utilize a build file. The build file is a vanilla node.js script for now, but this is a step toward using requireJS and webpack for modularity. For now this will allow these libraries to be updated easily (since the build is automatic), and to be reviewed more easily.</p>
        
        <h2>Update 2/11/16: WUI Development Priority List</h2>
        
        <p>The following is the result of an email thread I had with Hsin Fang Wang, and resulted in my priority list for the WUI:</p>

            <h2>REVIEW</h2>
            <p>
            NONE of the WUI code has been peer reviewed, and that is its greatest weakness. In the past year, peer review has driven me further as a programmer than anything else that has happened to me in the last ten years of programming. Period. Its the first order of business for me to get a good review framework set up for the WUI. I'm looking closely at <a href="http://phabricator.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Phabricator</a>, and will set up an instance as soon as I secure hosting, and hopefully that will excite people to join me!</p>

            <p>
            <b>In truth, I have no desire to develop the WUI any further without peer review.</b>&nbsp;It'll just get more messy if I'm left to my own devices. With good review, any nervousness in deploying new code is at least spread across a few more people.</p>

            <h3>Documentation</h3>
            <p>
            This is a subset of review because one of the most important elements of review is to make sure that the documentation matches and adequately describes the code - ensuring that another human can understand both. For now, I believe the best place to document the WUI is within the source code itself. Good documentation describes not just 'what' (and sometimes not even 'what'), but more importantly 'how' and 'why'.</p>

            <h2>TESTING</h2>

            <p>
            Unit tests, performance using&nbsp;<a href="https://jsperf.com/" target="_blank">jsPerf</a>, and eventually&nbsp;<a href="http://nightwatchjs.org/" target="_blank">Nightwatch</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank">Selenium</a>&nbsp;running cross-browser tests using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.browserstack.com/" target="_blank">BrowserStack</a>. I came across a great quote last week that goes like this:</p>

            <blockquote>
            	<q>Legacy code is any code without tests.</q>
            	<cite>Michael Feathers in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052" target="_blank"><i>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</i></a></cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In that sense, ALL of WUI 1.2.1 is legacy code! How great it would be to make a change to code, and have a massive battery of tests to run against it. We have a story here of an ex-Oracle employee who was asked about the value of their database software. His reply was that the software was worthless. The value, he said, was in the tests. Every time a customer would call with a problem, along with a ticket to fix the issue, a test was written to prove that the issue was fixed. Eventually the test suite became so large, that the software could be thrown out and replaced, and as long as it matched up to the testing suite they would know it was good. The test suite housed ALL of the value.</p>

            <h2>BACKLOG</h2>
            <p>With review and testing in place, I will be ready to expand on WUI 1.2.1. These are some issues I see as important, and I will speak to items you mention too:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Splitting the WUI down further into different components. Potentially adding AMD loading, if it ends up making sense for building components nicely, but I don't want someone to have to use grunt to build a WUI application.</li>
            <li>Removing dependencies on flexbox CSS styling, while retaining the existing CSS class and DOM structure. There are too many browser issues with legacy browsers and flexbox to justify using it. If the WUI is going to make it outside of USURF (and its starting to) the world isn't ready for flexbox. This will actually resolve the grid headers problem.</li>
            <li>Fixing the combo box is a definite priority. However, the current iteration of combo box is such a multi-faceted beast that it is unreasonable to work on it without a test structure in place. Wui.maxZ does perform as I desire it to. Indeed NOTHING should appear above a modal window. If your control is being messed up by maxZ, perhaps its just a wrong fit for your control. Modal windows and maxZ are a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>As far as sub-categories in Datalists are concerned, I struggle to conceptualize a good use case for such a feature. At least within the context of how I understand a Datalist along with its data-binding and interaction methods. That also gets into nesting, if I have top level categories, shouldn't I be able to go further? What are the interactions that surround category headers? Should the framework automatically apply those interactions, or what programmatic interface can it provide to let you customize them? I'm not against this feature, but again, I have a hard time conceptualizing a use case. If you're interested in the feature, I would say writing out in plain English the use case would be a great first step - and then peer reviewing that.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So that's my priority list for the WUI. I'm not implying that this list is entirely top to bottom in chronology, but it IS top to bottom in importance from my perspective.</p>
