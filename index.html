        <h1>Webteam User Interface (WUI) Project</h1>
        
        <h2>Update 2/11/15: WUI Dev Priority List</h2>
        
        <p>This is my priority list for the WUI from where I sit right now:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Review:</b> NONE of the WUI code has been peer reviewed. The MAIN thing that the WUI suffers from is 
            peer review. Peer review has driven me further as a programmer, and made my code better, than anything else 
            that has happened to me in the last ten years of programming. Its the first order of business for me to get 
            a good review framework set up for the WUI. Hopefully then, I can convince a few of you to review my code. 
            In truth, I have no desire to develop the WUI any further without review. It'll just get more messy if I'm 
            left to my own devices. With good review, any nervousness in deploying new code is at least spread across 
            a few more people.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Documentation:</b> This is a subset of review because one of the most important elements of 
                    review is to make sure that the documentation matches and adequately describes the code - ensuring that 
                    another human can understand both. For now, I believe the best place to document the WUI is within the 
                    source code itself. Good documentation describes not just 'what' (and sometimes not even 'what'), 
                    but more importantly 'how' and 'why'.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Testing:</b> Unit tests, performance using jsPerf, and eventually Nightwatch &amp; Selenium running 
                cross-browser tests using BrowserStack. I came across a great quote last week that goes like this:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <q>Legacy code is any code without tests.</q>
                    <cite>Michael Feathers in <i></i>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</i></cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In that sense, ALL of WUI 1.2.1 is legacy code! How great it would be to make a change to code, and 
                have a massive battery of tests to run against it. We have a story here of an ex-Oracle employee                     who was asked about the value of their database software. His reply was that the software was 
                worthless. The value, he said, was in the tests. Every time a customer would call with a problem, 
                along with a ticket to fix the issue, a test was written to prove that the issue was fixed. 
                Eventually the test suite became so large, that the software could be thrown out and replaced, and 
                as long as it matched up to the testing suite they would know it was good. The test suite housed 
                ALL of the value.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Backlog:</b> With review and testing in place, I will be ready to expand on WUI 1.2.1. 
                These are some issues I see as important, and I will speak to items you mention too:
                <ul>
                    <li>Splitting the WUI down further into different components. Potentially adding AMD loading, 
if it ends up making sense for building components nicely, but I don't want someone to 
have to use grunt to build a WUI application.</li>
                    <li>Removing dependencies on flexbox CSS styling, while retaining the existing CSS class and 
DOM structure. There are too many browser issues with legacy browsers and flexbox to 
justify using it. If the WUI is going to make it outside of USURF (and its starting to) 
the world isn't ready for flexbox. This will actually resolve the grid headers problem.</li>
                    <li>Fixing the combo box is a definite priority. However, the current iteration of combo box is such 
a multi-faceted beast that it is unreasonable to work on it without a test structure in place.
Wui.maxZ does perform as I desire it to. Indeed NOTHING should appear above a modal 
window. If your control is being messed up by maxZ, perhaps its just a wrong fit for your 
control. Modal windows and maxZ are a perfect fit.</li>
                    <li>As far as sub-categories in Datalists are concerned, I struggle to conceptualize a good use 
case for such a feature. At least within the context of how I understand a Datalist along 
with its data-binding and interaction methods. That also gets into nesting, if I have top 
level categories, shouldn't I be able to go further? What are the interactions that surround 
category headers? Should the framework automatically apply those interactions, or what 
programmatic interface can it provide to let you customize them?  I'm not against this feature, 
but again, I have a hard time conceptualizing a use case. If you're interested in the 
feature, I would say writing out in plain English the use case would be a great first step - 
and then peer reviewing that.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <p>So that's my priority list for the WUI. I'm not implying that this list is entirely 
            top to bottom in chronology, but it IS top to bottom in importance from my perspective.</p>
